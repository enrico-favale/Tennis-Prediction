# ðŸŽ¾ Tennis Match Outcome Prediction

## Project Overview

This project is focused on building a machine learning framework to **predict the outcomes of professional tennis matches**. The system leverages historical match data, betting odds, and contextual features to identify the most likely winner of a given match.

The primary goals are:

* To design a modular and extensible pipeline for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
* To achieve **robust predictive performance** using state-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithms such as XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost and a Neural network.
* To allow continuous updates as new matches are played, ensuring that the model adapts to current player form and emerging trends.

This project was developed by [**Enrico Favale**](https://github.com/enrico-favale) and [**Piergaetano Pio Palella**](https://github.com/PalellaPiergaetano).

## Installation

Before setting up the environment, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enrico-favale/Tennis-Prediction
cd Tennis-Prediction
```

This project provides two alternative ways to set up the Python environment for development and execution, depending on whether you want to use a pre-defined Conda environment or create a minimal environment using a `requirements.txt` file.

### Option 1: Use the provided Conda environment

If you want a fully configured environment with all dependencies already specified, follow these steps:

1. **Create the environment from the `environment.yml` file:**

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tennis_prediction
```

2. **Update the environment if needed:**

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

This ensures your environment is up-to-date with any new dependencies added to `environment.yml`.

This pipeline is faster for new users and guarantees that all versions are compatible.

### Option 2: Create an empty environment and install via `requirements.txt`

If you prefer to start from scratch or want more control over installed packages:

1. **Create an empty Conda environment:**

```bash
conda create -n tennis_prediction python=3.11
conda activate tennis_prediction
```

2. **Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This pipeline provides flexibility and allows you to adjust individual package versions, but it may require resolving compatibility issues manually.

Both options result in an environment ready for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.

## Usage

## Dataset

The project uses historical tennis match data collected from official ATP and WTA sources. The dataset includes:

* Match results and scores.
* Player statistics and rankings at the time of the match.
* Betting odds from multiple bookmakers.
* Surface type, tournament level, and match format (best-of-3, best-of-5).

Data is stored in CSV format, with each row representing a single match. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables. Additionally, context-based features are generated, such as:

* Player form in recent matches and recovery times.
* Career performances.
* Tournament and Surface performances.
* Head-to-head statistics.
* Close match indicators.

We would like to acknowledge and thank the data provider: [Dissfya on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dissfya/atp-tennis-2000-2023daily-pull) for making this comprehensive ATP dataset available, covering matches from 2000 to 2025.

## Features

The dataset used in this project contains a rich set of features capturing match, player, and context information. Key features include:

* **Tournament Info:** `Tournament`, `Date`, `Season`, `Series`, `Court`, `Surface`, `Round`, `Best of`
* **Player Info:** `Player_1`, `Player_2`, `Winner`
* **Ranking and Points:** `Rank_1`, `Rank_2`, `Pts_1`, `Pts_2`, `Rank_diff`, `Pts_diff`
* **Betting Odds:** `Odd_1`, `Odd_2`, `Odds_diff`
* **Head-to-Head Stats:** `H2H_wins_1`, `H2H_wins_2`, `H2H_diff`
* **Recent Performance:** `Win_pct_1_lastN`, `Win_pct_2_lastN`, `Win_pct_diff_lastN`, `Matches_played_1`, `Matches_played_2`
* **Career Stats:** `Career_wins_1`, `Career_losses_1`, `Career_matches_1`, `Career_win_pct_1`, `Career_wins_2`, `Career_losses_2`, `Career_matches_2`, `Career_win_pct_2`, `Career_win_pct_diff`, `Career_matches_diff`
* **Surface Performance:** `Surface_wins_1`, `Surface_losses_1`, `Surface_matches_1`, `Surface_win_pct_1`, `Surface_wins_2`, `Surface_losses_2`, `Surface_matches_2`, `Surface_win_pct_2`, `Surface_win_pct_diff`, `Surface_matches_diff`
* **Tournament Performance:** `Tournament_wins_1`, `Tournament_losses_1`, `Tournament_matches_1`, `Tournament_win_pct_1`, `Tournament_wins_2`, `Tournament_losses_2`, `Tournament_matches_2`, `Tournament_win_pct_2`, `Tournament_win_pct_diff`, `Tournament_matches_diff`
* **Match Timing:** `Days_since_last_match_1`, `Days_since_last_match_2`, `Days_diff`

These features allow the model to capture player form, historical performance, matchup dynamics, and betting market information, providing a comprehensive context for predicting match outcomes.
